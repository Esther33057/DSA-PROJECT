# Exploratory Data Analysis
This involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as;

What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments
Show insights on ratings based on gender
Analyse the company‚Äôs salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management

# Data Analysis
This is where we include some basic line of codes or used during analysis;

The first thing i did was to filter the gender and replace the name without gender with null on my Excel Sheet.
I took out the employers without salary.
I also took out the names without department.
I created another column and merged the employee data with the bonus rules. 
I calculated the amount to be paid to each employee ( salary inclusive of bonus)
I visualize my data using a Pie Chart and this included the total amount to be paid out per region.
